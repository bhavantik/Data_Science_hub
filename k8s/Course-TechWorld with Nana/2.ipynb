    "### ðŸ”¹ 1. **What Is a Docker Container (Reinforced)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Docker container** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **lightweight**, standalone, executable software package.\n",
    "  * Includes **everything needed** to run a program: code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.\n",
    "* Itâ€™s created from a **Docker image** and runs in **isolation** from the host system and other containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ§ª Think of it as a **running process that behaves like a lightweight VM**, but much faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Demo Walkthrough: Running a Container**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§© Example Command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run hello-world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Checks if `hello-world` image exists locally.\n",
    "  * If not, pulls it from Docker Hub.\n",
    "  * Creates a container from the image and runs it.\n",
    "  * Outputs a success message from inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”„ Behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Docker uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Image â†’ Container**\n",
    "  * Image is **read-only**\n",
    "  * Container is **read-write layer on top of the image**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Inspecting Docker Containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### View Running Containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker ps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### View All Containers (including stopped):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker ps -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remove a Container:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker rm <container_id>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remove an Image:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "docker rmi <image_id>\n",

    "### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Container Lifecycle**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Created** â†’ **Running** â†’ **Stopped** â†’ **Removed**\n",
    "* Once the process inside the container stops, the container stops too.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Why Containers Matter in Real Life**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developers can **test applications locally**, package them into containers, and deploy them to any system (e.g., GKE, ECS, Azure) without worrying about compatibility or environment differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Summary Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Docker **container** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **running instance** of an image.\n",
    "  * **Ephemeral** by default (dies when process ends unless specified).\n",
    "  * Can be started, stopped, restarted, deleted.\n",
