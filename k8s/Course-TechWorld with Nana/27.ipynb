    "## 🐳 **Docker**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **containerization platform** that packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run a single container or small apps on local or production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lightweight\n",
    "* Fast startup\n",
    "* Easy to build and run apps in any environment\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🐳🐳 **Docker Swarm**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Docker's **native clustering and orchestration tool**.\n",
    "* Helps manage a group of Docker engines (nodes) as a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simpler container orchestration (compared to Kubernetes).\n",
    "* Suitable for smaller setups needing basic scaling & failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy setup\n",
    "* Integrated into Docker CLI\n",
    "* Lightweight\n",
    "* Secure by default (TLS enabled)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limited features for complex deployments\n",
    "* Less active community and ecosystem than Kubernetes\n",

    "## ☸️ **Kubernetes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **open-source container orchestration platform** for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large-scale, production-grade systems with complex deployments, microservices, scaling, and monitoring needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Highly scalable\n",
    "* Rich ecosystem\n",
    "* Rolling updates, self-healing, auto-scaling\n",
    "* Backed by major cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Steeper learning curve\n",
    "* More setup and configuration needed\n",
