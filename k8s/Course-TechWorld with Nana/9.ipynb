    "## üß† 1. **Why Use Docker Compose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Docker Compose, developers had to manually run multiple `docker run` commands for each service and network. Compose simplifies this into a single configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`), making multi-container setups easy to launch and manage ([Medium][1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è 2. **Manual Docker Setup vs Compose**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without Compose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Docker network manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker network create mongo-network\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Run MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run -d -p 27017:27017 \\\n",
    "    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \\\n",
    "    -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret \\\n",
    "    --network mongo-network \\\n",
    "    --name mongodb mongo\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Run Mongo Express:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run -d -p 8081:8081 \\\n",
    "    -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin \\\n",
    "    -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret \\\n",
    "    -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb \\\n",
    "    --network mongo-network \\\n",
    "    --name mongo-express mongo-express\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires careful manual setup of ports, networks, variables, and startup order ([Medium][1]).\n",

    "| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `docker compose up`    | Builds and launches all services            |\n",
    "| `docker compose up -d` | Runs services in detached mode (background) |\n",
    "| `docker compose down`  | Stops & removes services and networks       |\n",
    "| `docker compose stop`  | Stops services but keeps containers         |\n",
    "| `docker compose logs`  | View logs for all services                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compose names containers using the project directory as a prefix.\n",
    "* Logs from all services are merged in the terminal ([Medium][1], [YouTube][2]).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåê 5. **Networking & Service Discovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compose sets up an automatic network with the same project name.\n",
    "* Services can talk via container names, e.g., `mongodb` ‚Üí `mongo-express`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîê 6. **Environment Variables & Secrets**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid hardcoding credentials in YAML.\n",
    "* Use environment variables:\n",

    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  - \"${ADMIN_USER}\"\n",
    "  - \"${ADMIN_PASS}\"\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "\n",
    "## üíæ 7. **Volumes & Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Containers are ephemeral.\n",
    "* Data must be persisted using Docker volumes.\n",
    "* Choose `stop` instead of `down` during development if you want to keep data intact ([Medium][1], [Class Central][3]).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ 8. **Publishing & Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build your own images and push them to registries like Docker Hub or AWS ECR.\n",
    "* After pushing, simply update the `image:` field in Compose and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker login\n",
    "  docker push\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Production deployment via Compose is as easy as local development ([Medium][1]).\n",

    "### üéØ Quick Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Docker Compose streamlines launching complex, multi-container apps.\n",
    "* `docker-compose.yml` centralizes configuration‚Äîports, env vars, volumes, networking, and dependencies.\n",
    "* Same environment works across development, staging, and production workflows.\n",
    "* Promotes clean, maintainable, and version-controlled container setups.\n",
