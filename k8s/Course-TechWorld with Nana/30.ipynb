    "\n",
    "A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes controller used to **manage stateful applications** â€” apps that **require stable, persistent identity and storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Deployments, which are used for **stateless** apps (e.g., web frontends), StatefulSets are used for **stateful** apps like:\n",
